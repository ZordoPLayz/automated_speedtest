This repository is a simple and easy to setup way to monitor your internet connection through the day, week or whatever you want.

Simply run the following command and everything will be installed autmatically:
´´´
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZordoPlayz/automated_speedtest/master/install.sh)
´´´

The script is intentioned to be used on, for example, a raspberry pi, but you can, of course, use it with any other linux based machine.
